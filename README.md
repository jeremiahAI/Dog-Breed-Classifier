# Dog Breed Classifier
This project attempts to create a pipeline that will process user input images of dogs and provide an estimate of the breed of dog contained in the images. If a picture of a human is supplied instead, the pipeline estimates the breed of dog the human most resembles.

## Dataset
Two datasets are used in this project, both provided by Udacity. One is a dataset of [dog images](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip), while the other is a dataset of [human images](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip). You may use either of the links to access the datasets.
